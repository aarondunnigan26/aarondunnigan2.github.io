# Research:

This is a partner project that I am working on with Daniel Lokas. We are working with the Pearl Rehabilitation Center at Atrium Health, here in Charlotte, to create a variety of assistive devices needed for the patients. The first one Daniel and I are working on is a robotic cup holder that will bring drinks close to the patients, so patients with limited mobility can easily take a drink of water without needing to ask their nurses. We are calling it the Adaptive Arm-Based Beverage Delivery System (AABBDS). The project will use the design from my robotic arm from my electrical engineering capstone as a base, and we will edit the code and hardware to be fit for the task at hand. 

__Attribution of Projects:__

The original project comes from the website "How to Mechatronics". Our project will remove the claw-like gripping device and replaces it with a cup holder. We use strong 20kg servos rather than 14kg servos so the arm can withstand the weight of heavy cups of beverages. We also plan to use a remote control rather than an app to control the arm while also giving the arm 3 preset conditions to streamline the usabilty, naking it easier for anyone to understand the controls. Lastly, we plan to remove the original base to replace it with a mount that easily mounts to a wheelchair.

# Documentation of Learning:

__Daily Journal:__

9/26: We visited the Pearl Rehab center, and had the chance to sit in on appointments, see the kind of people who need this project, and ask specific questions on how our projects would work. 

9/25: Started with a practice soldering board and soldered 3 resistors. I then began working on the actual owl soldering board 

9/29: Continued with the owl soldering board 

9/30: Finished soldering all components on the board, but it did not light up. 

10/1: Absent in class 

10/6: Finished soldering my board, fixing the solder bridges

10/7:  I researched designs for the cup holder section of the arm, like making the cup holder magnetic or using an unspillable cup holder so that bumps or rapid movement would not lead to the cup spilling. I used Flint AI to give me ideas on how to have cup designs

10/9: Daniel and I visited my previous project to see what parts should be modified to accommodate the needs of this project. We will change the base to a mount that can be mounted on wheelchairs. We sketched out our design in Notability to think about how cadding would work

10/10: Daniel and I thought of questions to email the Pearl group about and what we would need to see at the next meeting

10/14-24: We worked on setting up a digital portfolio in GitHub with Mr. Dubick.

10/27-31: We were introduced to a CAM soffware called: MakeraCam. We learned how to take PCB disign files and mill them out on our PCB Machines. We continued to learn how to use the software while also writing a workflow, which is shown in the PCB documention post.

11/3: I worked with daniel to disuss what parts of the project needed to be edited. 

11/4: I millted my PCB board with raaj. 

11/6-11: I spent researching a holding device for the cup that would significantly reduce the amount of spills during sudent movements

11/12: I found a cup design that would work and we then printed it and tested it with a paper cup filled with water. The test was successfull so we had our starting design that we could work with

11/13-14: In class we worked on locating our mountain ranges for our topography maps and then made CRV files for them on the Bamboo studio software. 

![PCB Image](/assets/images/DunniganA.crv3d)

11/17-11/19: absent because ill

11/20: Began to learn how ot use Aspire to create a CNC file to mill my topography map.

11/21-11/30: break

12/1-5: We worked with electronics on TinkerCad

12/9: I drafted an email to send to the pearl team to schedule our next visit to the rehab center. We plan to go with the other class first period next week. 

12/10: We had dates confused so we had to schedule a seperate visit, not wiht the other class. I then finished the email and sent it out. I began to add to the original giro-cup design in fusion360

12/11: I continued designing a bottom to our giro cup holder. 

12/12: I completee the first prototype that we could show the Physical therapists at the pearl. 

![PCB Image](/assets/images/Giro%20Cup%202.stl)

12/15: Today we printed the prototype design. I also had to continue using aspire for to create my CNC file. We also agreed to visit the Rehab center on Thurday 12/18.  

12/16: The file failed because the nosel on the printer go jammed. We then print the file again. I finished makeding my CNC file on aspire and then I milled my topography map

12/17: the file again did not print, this time it was because the bed was not alligned properly so in kept knocking into the display off centering the print more and more. The print was already thrown out by the time we saw the printer, so there are no photos. We printed it again.

12/18: Today we were supposed to visit the Carolinas Rehab Center, however I had the flu so we had to postpone the trip to another day. 

1/6: I wrote down our plan for everything to make sure that I had a plan for everything until the project due date. I printed the cup holder again, and it failed

1/7-9: We worked on a task analysis sheet, a Gantt chart, and sent an email to the Rehab center. 

1/12: I looked through different button options that we could use as a switch to alternate between the arm's two preset conditions. I then. I also printed a prototype for the gyro cup. I learned, though, that it does not print well if

1/14:  Today, Daniel and I both visited the Carolina rehab center to show them our different button ideas and how far we had come in the project. During this meeting, we also learned about how we would need to mount the arm to the back of the wheelchair and the best placements for the arm. 

1/15: Today was when I began to work on designing our updated cup holder design in Fusion 360.

1/20-27: I continued to work on the cup holder design in Fusion 360. I decided to scrap the version I had edited from the design online, and I created my own version to allow more freedom when I was designing it. I added a cup to it to allow for a wider variety of cups to fit in. I also added two rods that stuck out of the innermost circle, and the two other circles had much larger diameters. This allowed for a lot more degrees of rotation, which was necessary for the cup to prevent spills. There were also a couple of snow days that caused the project to take longer than expected.

1/28: I printed my first version of the cup holder. This version's outermost circle was too wide, and the holes in the cones on the middle circle were too loose, which allowed the cup to easily fall out

1/29: I spent my class period fixing the issues mentioned above

1/30-2/3: We had multiple snow days again

2/4-5: I continued to work on fixing the issues, and I printed the new version of the cup

2/6: There was still an issue where the middle cup was too loose around the two extensions that I made. To fix this, I added two boxes with holes that allowed rotation while also securing the cup. I also made the outermost circle tighter to make sure the cup holder was secure. I designed and printed small attachments that would allow me to connect the cup holder to arm 2 using screws and a hex key. The print was very quick, and I was able to do it all in one class period. When I attached the connectors to arm 2, I had an issue because the lab did not have a large supply of M3 screws. 

2/7-2/11: Out of class due to swim competition and illness

2/12:  I printed the new design for the middle circle. I forgot to add one whole to the outermost circle, so the design didn't work out as intended. I also saw that the lab had a large variety of M2.5 screws in different lengths, so I changed the screw hole sizes to 2.5mm in Fusion 360. I printed this again, and I had to reprint my arm design and the circles for the cup holder because they also needed the screw holes sized. Everything then fit a lot better and made for a much cleaner design. Lastly, I had to edit the file for arm 1 to make it longer, when I tried to do this in Fusion 360, there was an inverted face that led to the mesh file not being converted correctly to a solid body. 

2/18: I used Blender to edit the file instead, which brought its own set of challenges. In Blender, there wasn't a dimension tool, and the files would be uploaded at 100x their original size. To fix this, I would have to scale the STL file down, create a cube the size I wanted to stretch arm 1 to next to my file, line up their right edges, and then stretch the left end of the arm 1 file to the left edge of the cube. I then deleted the cube and exported the new STL file. I printed this file to be ready the next day. 

2/19: I grabbed the edited prints. I also cut a piece of wood, drilled 2.5mm holes in it, and aligned it with the base of the arm that I designed. I then screwed the m 2.5 screws in and had a more solid base to deal with balance issues the arm may have. The wood plank will serve as a temporary replacement for the back of the wheelchair because we can not have one in the lab with us. 

2/20: I worked on integrating the electronics with the 3D printed components to put the full device together. 

__Challenges and Important Decisions Made to Overcome Them:__

When I initially brainstormed the idea, the first challenge that I saw was that if the cup holder were to move between the two preset conditions, the cup would likely spill. To solve this, I decided that we would use a self-balancing design that would keep the cup's mass centered as long as there were smooth movements. We found a design for a self-balancing cup holder on 11/12. 

The initial design found, though, was only compatable with certain-sized cups, because the cup would fall through without the right tapering. So if the patient were to use a fast-food cup, they would need someone else to transfer the drink to a cup compatible with the design. To fix this, I edited the design to add a bottom to the cup holder that would hold any shaped cup, preventing it from falling through.

Originally, my print failed because the nozzle on the printer was clogged. When I reprinted it on a different printer, the bed was not placed correctly, so it kept hitting against the display. The print was stopped by a teacher and thrown out before I was able to see through it.
